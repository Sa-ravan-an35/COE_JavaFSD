First, create a custom component under the path apps/{your_project_name}/components with the type cq:component.
Add a property with the following details:

    Name: componentGroup
    Type: string
    Value: {your_project_name}/Content

Create an HTML file to define the structure of your component.
Add a cq:dialog node, and copy the properties from an existing component's cq:dialog.
Now you can integrate your custom component into your page.
Validation must be handled through a JavaScript file, so create a folder with the type cq:ClientLibraryFolder.
Inside that folder, add your JavaScript file for the validation functionality.
